I was hopeful due to the many great reviews about this adapter that it would work properly. My issue now is that I don't believe that I can return the item in its present condition.

Know its limitations in advance and you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nI bought this adapter so that I could mount my EF lenses to my Lumix GX85, which is a micro four-thirds camera. There is no aperture control or autofocus with your EF lenses while using this adapter, so be aware of this before purchasing. If you want to use an aperture other than wide open on any of your lenses, do the following: Mount the lens to your EF-mount Canon DSLR camera body. Set the desired aperture using your Canon camera. Hold the depth-of-field preview button. While holding the button, remove the lens from the Canon DSLR. The aperture is now set. You can verify this by looking at the lens and verifying the aperture blades have made a smaller circle than previously.\n\nThe lens I primarily use for this adapter is my Sigma 35mm f/1.4 art. Because the GX85 has a 2x crop factor, it effectively acts like a 70mm lens with good macro focusing capabilities. It's fantastic for my YouTube channel - way better image quality and DOF than the stock MFT lens.\n\nFit is also very precise and tight.
